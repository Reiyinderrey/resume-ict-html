<h1 align="center"> TREE </h1>
<h3 align="center"> Joyce Kilmer </h3>
<p align="center"><br> I think that
<br> I shall never see
<br> A poem lovely as a tree.
<br> A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed
<br> Against the Earth's sweet flowing breast;
<br> A tree that looks at God all day, And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
<br> A tree that may in Summer wear, A nest of robins in her hair;
<br> Upon whose bosom snow has lain; Who intimately lives with rain.
<br> Poems are made 
<br> by fools like me,
<br> but only God 
<br> can make a tree.  </p>
